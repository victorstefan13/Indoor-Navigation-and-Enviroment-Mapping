# Indoor-Navigation-and-Enviroment-Mapping
This repository will be used for my final year project. This project focuses on a indoor navigation system for visually impaired using Deep Learning and Monocular Slam.  

Current usage: ./Indoor-Navigation-and-Enviroment-Mapping/slam-modified/ORB_SLAM2/live_mapping/live_slam Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt live_mapping/TUM1.yaml 
		in new terminal: python3 pyreq.py
TO DO: 

Integrate tcp socket in slam algorithm - done
Detect object using Tensorflow and Python
If door is detect send the data to Slam
Change the colour of the map points when mapping the enviroment
